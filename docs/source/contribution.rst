Contribution Guide
==================

This is a guide for all contributions to vecto.
The development of vecto is happening on `the official repository at GitHub <https://github.com/vecto-ai/vecto>`_.

Some quick notes:
-----------------

Please send pull requests to the ``dev`` branch.

Pull requests must not lower test coverage score. 

If you send a pull request, please make sure your code is pep8-compliant.

If you want to raise an ussue, please first do a quick search to see if it has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just leave a comment on an existing issue, rather than creating a new one.

Issues are for bug reports, feature requests etc. For usage-related questions please consult the tutorial; if something is not covered, raise an issue, and we will update the tutorial. 

If there's an issue you would like to fix - this is very welcome, please get in touch.
